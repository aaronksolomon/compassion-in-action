      <h2>Calling for a Ceasefire and the Release of Hostages</h2>

      <p><strong>During the war in Vietnam, Thầy (Thich Nhat Hanh) called for a unilateral ceasefire</strong>—not as a political strategy, but as a deep act of compassion. Many said the war was necessary to stop communism, but Thầy reminded us not to be caught in ideology.</p>

      <p>Today, we hear similar justifications for violence. Yet we know that bombs and weapons do not defeat ideas. <strong>War and violence often strengthens ideologies. Violence, and our fear of it, cannot be overcome with more violence.</strong></p>

      <p>Millions of people are starving, bombs continue to fall. Cities are turned to rubble. Hostages are still being held. <strong>The suffering is unimaginable.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Acknowledging that many of our governments are directly supporting or participating in violence, we cannot be silent.</strong></p>

      <p>The <strong>14 Mindfulness Trainings</strong>, born in the fire of war, call us as a community to act together, nurturing seeds of compassion and peace in this moment, transcending notions and views:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Ninth Training calls us</strong> to speak truthfully and lovingly against injustice—even when it threatens our safety. </li>
        <li><strong>The Tenth Training reminds us</strong> we must take a clear stand against oppression and injustice, while not using our community as a political instrument.</li>
        <li><strong>The Twelfth Training calls us to protect life.</strong> Not to kill, and not to let others kill. </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>We also affirm: to peacefully challenge Israeli and US state violence is love in action</strong>—not antisemitism, not hatred, not support for opposing violence or a particular political outcome.</p>

      <p>We affirm the right of all people to self-determination, safety, and justice.</p>

      <p><strong>We call on all practitioners in the Plum Village tradition—and all people moved by compassion—to raise again and again the call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and beyond and the release of all hostages.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>We call for immediate international action to protect human life, support humanitarian aid, and the use of diplomacy, sanctions, boycotts, nonviolent civil disobedience, and the withdrawal of all military support to end the violence.</strong></p>

      <p>We aspire to look at everyone with the eyes of compassion, even those presently causing harm. We commit to cultivating our own understanding, compassion, and peace through our collective and personal practice and through building community.</p>

      <p>We commend all actions of all people everywhere, all practitioners, both lay and monastic, working together, both quietly and publicly, toward compassion, justice, and peace.</p>

      <h2>Building Sangha for Sustained Action</h2>
      <p>This call to action aspires to connect the already existing and diverse community of practitioners engaged and committed to nonviolent responses to suffering, as well as those wishing to find new ways to engage. Through collective practice of the 14 Mindfulness Trainings, we aspire to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create ongoing support for compassionate action</li>
        <li>Coordinate nonviolent responses to injustice</li>
        <li>Practice deep listening across difference</li>
        <li>Build bridges between communities</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>We aspire to grow a network able to support existing and new local sangha organizing, study and practice spaces, and coordinated peaceful action.</em></p>

      <h2>Wisdom from Our Teacher</h2>
      <p>These teachings from Thầy guide our understanding of nonviolent response to conflict:</p>

      <details class="reference-item">
        <summary><strong>Letter from Thầy on War and Peace</strong></summary>
        <div class="reference-content">
          <p><em>From "In Love and Trust"</em></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Dear friends,</p>
            <p>I know that you are suffering, just as I am. War not only kills people; it also destroys the most beautiful and fragile elements in the human soul. I have seen children die from bombs, mothers weeping beside the bodies of their children. I have seen young soldiers — from both sides — with empty eyes, the eyes of those who have lost faith in humanity.</p>
            <p>I am not writing these lines to accuse anyone, but to share a truth: we cannot kill each other and expect peace.</p>
            <p>We need to sit down together, not as enemies, but as human beings who suffer, who long to live in safety and harmony.</p>
            <p>As a monk, I do not take sides in a war. I choose the side of peace. I choose to stand with all those who believe that love is stronger than hatred, that deep understanding can transform fear and anger.</p>
            <p>If you truly want to end war, you cannot only go out and protest in the streets. You must also turn inward to see the roots of violence within yourself: discrimination, indifference, and anger.</p>
            <p>We need a revolution —but not a revolution of violence. We need a revolution of consciousness, a revolution of mindfulness, a revolution of love.</p>
            <p>Each mindful breath, each peaceful step, each word spoken with understanding— is an act of peace.</p>
            <p>I believe you can do this. And I pray for you, just as I pray for all who are lost, who are suffering, and who are searching for the way home.</p>
            <p>Peace is not a dream. Peace is real — if you live each moment in peace.</p>
            <p>With love,<br>Thích Nhất Hạnh</p>

        <summary><strong>A Proposal for Peace (Vietnam War)</strong></summary>
        <div class="reference-content">
          <p><em>From "Love in Action, Writings on Nonviolent Social Change"</em></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Since coming to the United States, I have been asked repeatedly to outline concrete proposals for ending the strife in Vietnam... My solution would be along the following lines:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>A cessation of the bombing, north and south.</li>
              <li>Limitation of all military operations by U.S. and South Vietnamese forces to defensive actions: in effect, a cease-fire if the Vietcong respond in kind.</li>
              <li>A convincing demonstration of the U.S. intention to withdraw its forces from Vietnam over a specified period of months, with withdrawal actually beginning to take place as a sign of sincerity.</li>
              <li>A clear statement by the U.S. of its desire to help the Vietnamese people to have a government truly responsive to Vietnamese aspirations...</li>
              <li>A generous effort to help rebuild, in light of the destruction that has been wreaked upon Vietnam...</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Finally, if some may question why I ask the U.S. to take the first step, it is because the U.S. is militarily the strongest nation in the world. No one can accuse it of cowardice if it chooses to seek peace. To be a genuine leader requires moral strength as well as big guns. America's history suggests that she has the potential to provide the world this leadership.</p>

        <summary><strong>Understanding Both Sides</strong></summary>
        <div class="reference-content">
          <p><em>From "Being Peace"</em></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>During the war in Vietnam, we young Buddhists organized ourselves to help victims of the war rebuild villages that had been destroyed by the bombs. Many of us died during service, not only because of the bombs and the bullets, but because of the people who suspected us of being on the other side. We were able to understand the suffering of both sides, the communists and the anti-communists. We tried to be open to both, to understand this side and to understand that side, to be one with them. That is why we did not take a side, even though the whole world took sides.</p>
            <p>We tried to tell people our perception of the situation: that we wanted to stop the fighting. But the bombs were so loud. Sometimes we had to burn ourselves alive to get the message across, but even then the world couldn't hear us. They thought it was a political action. They didn't know that it was a purely human action to be heard, to be understood. We didn't want a victory, we wanted reconciliation.</p>
            <p>The situation of the world is still like this. People identify completely with one side, one ideology. To understand the suffering and the fear of a citizen of another country, we have to become one with him. To do so is dangerous—we will be suspected by both sides. But if we don't do it, if we align ourselves with one side or the other, we will lose our chance to work for peace. Reconciliation is to understand both sides, to go to one side and describe the suffering being endured by the other side, and then to go to the other side and describe the suffering being endured by the first side. Doing only that will be a great help for peace.</p>
